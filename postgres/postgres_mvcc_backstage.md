# PostgreSQL MVCC Backstage

Description: TBD

## Prerequisites

TBD

## Start PostgreSQL

1. Create a directory for the Postgres container's volume:

    ```shell
    rm -r ~/postgres-volume
    mkdir ~/postgres-volume
    ```

2. Start a Postgres container:

    ```shell
    docker run --name postgres \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
        -p 5432:5432 \
        -v ~/postgres-volume/:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -d postgres:latest
    ```

3. Wait for Postgres to finish the initialization:

    ```shell
    ! while ! docker exec -it postgres pg_isready -U postgres; do sleep 1; done
    ```

## Discover Hidden Columns

Every row in Postgres has a 23-byte header that precedes the columns you define in the table schema. This header [contains 8 fields](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-page-layout.html#STORAGE-TUPLE-LAYOUT), primarily used by the database engine internally.

First, create a sample table:

1. Connect to the database:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
    ```

2. Create a sample table:

    ```sql
    create table account(id int, balance money);
    ```

3. Add a row to the table:

    ```sql
    insert into account values (1, 500);
    ```

Next, execute a very familiar request:

```sql
select * from account;
```

```output
 xmin | id | balance 
------+----+---------
  733 |  1 | $500.00
(1 row)
```

The `*` does return all the columns but hidden:

```sql
select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account;
```

```output
 ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance 
-------+------+------+----+---------
 (0,1) |  733 |    0 |  1 | $500.00
(1 row)
```

* `ctid` - a row identifier within the page.
* `xmin` - an ID of the transaction created the row.
* `xmax` - an ID of the transaction deleted the row (`0` means the row is not deleted and visible to all requests).

Add two more rows and check the values of their hidden columns:

1. Add the rows:

    ```sql
    insert into account values (2, 600), (3, 700);
    ```

2. Read all the rows back:

    ```sql
    select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account;
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance

    -------+------+------+----+---------
    (0,1) |  733 |    0 |  1 | $500.00
    (0,2) |  734 |    0 |  2 | $600.00
    (0,3) |  734 |    0 |  3 | $700.00
    (3 rows)
    ```

## The Purpose for Hidden Columns

Why does PostgreSQL keep the hidden columns in the header of every row? It's **necessary for its MVCC engine**.
Postgres can store several versions of a single row at a time and those hidden columns help to control the visibility of the versions for running transactions/queries.

Start a transaction and run a few experiments:

1. Begin the transaction:

    ```shell
    begin;
    ```

2. Get the current value of the first row:

    ```sql
    select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account where id = 1;
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance

    -------+------+------+----+---------
    (0,1) |  733 |    0 |  1 | $500.00
    (1 row)
    ```

3. Update the balance:

    ```sql
    update account set balance=400 where id = 1;
    ```

4. Read the row back:

    ```sql
    select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account where id = 1;
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance

    -------+------+------+----+---------
    (0,4) |  737 |    0 |  1 | $400.00
    (1 row)
    ```

5. Make sure that the `xmin` is equal to the ID of the current started transaction:

    ```sql
    select txid_current_if_assigned();
    ```

    ```output
     txid_current_if_assigned

    --------------------------
                        737
    (1 row)
    ```

Now, neither commit nor about this transaction. Open another session with Postgres and read the value of the record that is being modified:

1. Connect:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
    ```

2. Read the row:

    ```sql
    select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account where id = 1;
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance

    -------+------+------+----+---------
    (0,1) |  733 |  737 |  1 | $500.00
    (1 row)
    ```

You'll see the previous balance with `xmin` set to the value of the transaction that inserted the row for the first time. However, the `xmax` is already set to the transaction that have "deleted" this version.

This example shows why MVCC is important. This request from the second session must see only the value that is already committed. Why? The first transaction might never commit.

1. Return to the first session and abort the transaction:

    ```sql
    abort;
    ```

2. Go back to the second session and query the record:

    ```sql
    select ctid, xmin, xmax, * from account where id = 1;
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | xmin | xmax | id | balance

    -------+------+------+----+---------
    (0,1) |  733 |  737 |  1 | $500.00
    (1 row)
    ```

Why `xmax` is not `0` any longer. *It is possible for this column to be nonzero in a visible row version. That usually indicates that the deleting transaction hasnâ€™t committed yet, or that an attempted deletion was rolled back.* - [read more here](https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/whats-in-an-xmax/).

## Dead Tuples

What happens to old versions of a row once they are no longer needed. The database will keep storing them until the next garbage collection cycle. Yes, you heard me well, Postgres has a garbage collector. But before let's see how the old versions get generated by MVCC.

1. Install the `pageinspect` extension:

    ```sql
    create extension pageinspect;
    ```

2. See all the versions of all the records of the `account` table:

    ```sql
    SELECT lp, t_ctid, t_xmin, t_xmax, t_data
    FROM heap_page_items(get_raw_page('account', 0));  
    ```

    ```output
     lp | t_ctid | t_xmin | t_xmax |               t_data
    ----+--------+--------+--------+------------------------------------
    1 | (0,4)  |    733 |    737 | \x010000000000000050c3000000000000
    2 | (0,2)  |    734 |      0 | \x020000000000000060ea000000000000
    3 | (0,3)  |    734 |      0 | \x03000000000000007011010000000000
    4 | (0,4)  |    737 |      0 | \x0100000000000000409c000000000000
    (4 rows)
    ```

Question. The version of the row with `lp=2` was never committed. But how does Postgres know that it has to return the version of the row with `lp=1`?
There are special flags. Let's look at them:

1. Create a special function that makes it easy to read the flags:

    ```sql
    create function heap_page(relname text, pageno_from integer, pageno_to integer)

    returns table (ctid tid, state text, xmin text, xmin_age integer, xmax text,
    hhu text, /*heap hot update - the version is referenced from an index, traverse to the next version using ctid ref */
    hot text, /* heap only tuple - the version is created only in heap without the index update*/
    t_ctid tid
    )
    AS $$
    select (pageno,lp)::text::tid as ctid,
        case lp_flags
        when 0 then 'unused'
        when 1 then 'normal'
        when 2 then 'redirect to '||lp_off
        when 3 then 'dead'
        end as state,
        t_xmin || case
        when (t_infomask & 256+512) = 256+512 then ' f'
        when (t_infomask & 256) > 0 then ' c'
        when (t_infomask & 512) > 0 then ' a'
        else ''
        end as xmin,
        age(t_xmin) as xmin_age,
        t_xmax || case
        when (t_infomask & 1024) > 0 then ' c'
        when (t_infomask & 2048) > 0 then ' a'
        else ''
        end as xmax,
        case when (t_infomask2 & 16384) > 0 then 't' end as hhu,
        case when (t_infomask2 & 32768) > 0 then 't' end as hot,
        t_ctid
    from generate_series(pageno_from, pageno_to) p(pageno),
        heap_page_items(get_raw_page(relname,pageno))
    order by pageno, lp;
    $$ language sql;
    ```

2. Read the records of the first page:

    ```sql
    select * from heap_page('account', 0, 0);
    ```

    ```output
     ctid  | state  | xmin  | xmin_age | xmax  | hhu | hot | t_ctid

    -------+--------+-------+----------+-------+-----+-----+--------
    (0,1) | normal | 733 c |        9 | 737 a | t   |     | (0,4)
    (0,2) | normal | 734 c |        8 | 0 a   |     |     | (0,2)
    (0,3) | normal | 734 c |        8 | 0 a   |     |     | (0,3)
    (0,4) | normal | 737 a |        5 | 0 a   |     | t   | (0,4)
    (4 rows)
    ```

The `xmax` set to `737 a` for the version with `(0,1)` implies that the transaction with id `737` was `a`borted. The `xmin` of the version with `(0,4)` is set to `737 a` meaning this version was aborted. That's why the version with ctid `(0,1)` will be visible to all future requests.

## Garbage Collection

Let's update each row by adding $100 to every account:

```sql
update account set balance = balance + 100::money;
```

Make sure that there only three rows in the table:

```sql
select * from account;
```

But now take a look at the Postgres heap:

```sql
select * from heap_page('account', 0, 0);
```

```output
 ctid  | state  | xmin  | xmin_age | xmax  | hhu | hot | t_ctid 
-------+--------+-------+----------+-------+-----+-----+--------
 (0,1) | normal | 733 c |       10 | 742 c | t   |     | (0,5)
 (0,2) | normal | 734 c |        9 | 742 c | t   |     | (0,6)
 (0,3) | normal | 734 c |        9 | 742 c | t   |     | (0,7)
 (0,4) | normal | 737 a |        6 | 0 a   |     | t   | (0,4)
 (0,5) | normal | 742 c |        1 | 0 a   |     | t   | (0,5)
 (0,6) | normal | 742 c |        1 | 0 a   |     | t   | (0,6)
 (0,7) | normal | 742 c |        1 | 0 a   |     | t   | (0,7)
(7 rows)
```

Repeat one more time to see even more dead versions:

```sql
update account set balance = balance + 100::money;
select * from account;
select * from heap_page('account', 0, 0);
```

The dead versions are eventually garbage collected by the vacuum process. You can run it manually for the table:

```sql
vacuum account;
```

And now you'll see that there are only three version for the rows in the Postgres heap:

```sql
select * from heap_page('account', 0, 0);
```

```output
  ctid  |     state      | xmin  | xmin_age | xmax | hhu | hot | t_ctid 
--------+----------------+-------+----------+------+-----+-----+--------
 (0,1)  | redirect to 8  |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,2)  | redirect to 9  |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,3)  | redirect to 10 |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,4)  | unused         |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,5)  | unused         |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,6)  | unused         |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,7)  | unused         |       |          |      |     |     | 
 (0,8)  | normal         | 743 f |        1 | 0 a  |     | t   | (0,8)
 (0,9)  | normal         | 743 f |        1 | 0 a  |     | t   | (0,9)
 (0,10) | normal         | 743 f |        1 | 0 a  |     | t   | (0,10)
(10 rows)
```

The other space will be reused. It's not defragmented. If you want to defragment it and return back to the OS, then you can run `vacuum full`:

```sql
vacuum full account;

select * from heap_page('account', 0, 0);
```

```output
 ctid  | state  | xmin  | xmin_age | xmax | hhu | hot | t_ctid 
-------+--------+-------+----------+------+-----+-----+--------
 (0,1) | normal | 743 f |        2 | 0 a  |     |     | (0,1)
 (0,2) | normal | 743 f |        2 | 0 a  |     |     | (0,2)
 (0,3) | normal | 743 f |        2 | 0 a  |     |     | (0,3)
(3 rows)
```

This is the MVCC backstage in Postgres. MVCC is implemented by creating TBD (finish)
