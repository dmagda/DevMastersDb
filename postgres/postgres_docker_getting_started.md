# Getting Started With PostgreSQL in Docker: From Setup to Sample App

Discover the fastest way to get a fully functional PostgreSQL instance running in Docker with this comprehensive beginner's guide. Master the art of setting up PostgreSQL in Docker, connecting to your database with various SQL tools, and integrating with a sample app on your host system or within a container. Perfect for beginners and seasoned pros alike!

Follow this guide to learn:
* How to start Postgres in a Docker container
* How to use psql to open a database session within the container
* How to generate sample data with generate series
* How to connect to Postgres from the host with DBeaver
* How to connect to Postgres from an app running on the host OS and within a container

## Start Postgres in Docker

1. Create a sample network for a Postgres container and a sample app used in this guide:
    ```shell
    docker network create my-network
    ```
2. Create `postgres-volume` directory for the Postgres container's volume in your home dir. The volume is handy if you'd like to access the logs easily and don't want to lose data when the container is recreated from scratch:
    ```shell
    mkdir ~/postgres-volume
    ```
3. Start the Postgres container of version 16:
    ```shell
    docker run --name postgres --net my-network \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
        -p 5432:5432 \
        -v ~/postgres-volume/:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -d postgres:16.1
    ```
    You can pick another version from the [Postgres' official Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
4. Make sure the container is running:
    ```shell
    docker container ls -f name=postgres
    ```
5. Connect to the container and open a database session with *psql*:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres 
    ```

Keep the psql session open...

## Load Sample Data

Use the opened psql session to create a sample table and load it with mock data:

1. Create the table:
    ```sql
    create table pizza_order(id int, pizza_type text);
    ```
2. Insert 1000 records in the table:
    ```sql
    with recipe as (
        select array['four cheese', 'margherita', 'veggie', 'pepperoni'] as type
    )
    insert into pizza_order (id, pizza_type)
    select id, (select type[(id % 4) +1 ] from recipe)
    from generate_series(1, 1000) as id;
    ```
3. Select 5 records:
    ```sql
    select * from pizza_order limit 5;
    ```

## Connect With DBeaver

Start DBeaver on your host's operating system (OS) and connect to the Postgres instance running in the container.

Use the following connection parameters:
* *Host* - localhost or 127.0.0.1
* *Port* - 5432 (was exposed in the Docker run command)
* *Username* - postgres
* *Password* - password

## Connect From App Running on Host

Create a simple Node.js application, start it on the host's operating system and have it connected to the Postgres instance running in docker.


1. Create the `cool_app` folder for the app:
    ```shell
    mkdir cool_app 
    ```
2. Init a Node.js project:
    ```shell
    cd cool_app
    npm init -y
    ```
3. Add the *node-postgres* module to the project:
    ```shell
    npm install pg
    ```
4. Open the app with Visual Studio Code:
    ```shell
    code .
    ```

Create the `main.js` file with the following contents:
```javascript
var pg = require('pg');

const config = {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: '5432',
    database: 'postgres',
    user: 'postgres',
    password: 'password',
};

async function mostPopularPizza() {
    const client = new pg.Client(config);
    await client.connect();

    const res = await client.query(
        'select pizza_type, count(*) as total_orders ' +
        'from pizza_order ' +
        'group by pizza_type order by total_orders desc');

    for (let row of res.rows) {
        console.log(row);
    }

    await client.end();
}

mostPopularPizza();
```

Start the app instance:
```shell
node main.js
```

An app instance will be started on your host operating system. It will connect to the Postgres container and print the following result:
```javascript
node main.js
{ pizza_type: 'veggie', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'margherita', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'four cheese', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'pepperoni', total_orders: '250' }
```

## Connect From App Running in Container

Create a docker image for the app and start it as a container alongside the Postgres instance.

1. Under the app's root directory create the following Dockerfile:
    ```docker
    # Use an official Node runtime as a parent image
    FROM node:16

    # Set the working directory in the container to /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Install any needed packages specified in package.json
    RUN npm install

    # Define environment variable
    ENV NODE_ENV=production

    # Run app.js (or whatever your main file is) when the container launches
    CMD ["node", "main.js"]
    ```

2. Set the `host` parameter to `postgres` in the `main.js` logic:
    ```javascript
    const config = {
        host: 'postgres',
        ...
    }
    ```
    where `postgres` is the name of the Postgres container.

3. Build the image:
    ```shell
    docker build -t my-cool-app .
    ```

4. Start the app in a container in the same Docker network where you have the Postgres instance running:
    ```shell
    docker run --net my-network --name app my-cool-app
    ```

The app will start successfully in the container, connect to Postgres and print the following result:
```javascript
{ pizza_type: 'veggie', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'margherita', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'four cheese', total_orders: '250' }
{ pizza_type: 'pepperoni', total_orders: '250' }
```
